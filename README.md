## Overview
This project is a collaborative effort developed with students in the Adakdemy classes. The primary goal was to create a family of intelligent AI assistants, each specialized in solving unique problems using advanced technologies. We implemented seven different AI models, all leveraging the Gemini API for calling functions and answering queries. Additionally, we utilized Vosk AI for local speech recognition, ensuring faster and more accurate performance.

Each project demonstrates how AI can enhance productivity and creativity in various domains. Below is a detailed description of each project.

### **5. Vincenzo Palladino and Augusto Anselmetti Project: AI for YouTube Video Search and Download**
**Description:** This AI assistant searches for YouTube videos based on user input and downloads them directly for offline use.

**Key Features:**
- Searches YouTube using natural language queries.
- Downloads videos in the desired quality.
- Saves time and provides offline access to content.

---

### **6. Joseph Nicholls Project: AI for PowerPoint Presentations**
**Description:** This AI assistant helps users create PowerPoint presentations tailored to their needs. It generates slides based on the specified topic and opens them in Microsoft PowerPoint for final adjustments.

**Key Features:**
- Creates visually appealing slides with structured content.
- Compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint.
- Boosts efficiency for students, professionals, and educators.

- **Customizability:** Allow more personalization options for each assistant’s output.
- **Expanded Functionality:** Integrate additional APIs and features to increase versatility.

## Conclusion
This project represents a significant step in exploring the potential of AI in daily life and professional tasks. Each assistant is a testament to the creativity and technical skills of the Adakdemy students, providing practical solutions and inspiring further innovation in AI development.

## Packages Used

Below is an explanation of the main packages used in the development of this project, along with their installation commands:

- **google.generativeai**: This package is used to interact with Google's Gemini API, enabling the creation of AI-generated responses for the assistants. It is crucial for calling functions and generating intelligent answers that define the assistant's behavior.

  ```bash
  pip install google-generativeai
  ```

- **Vosk**: Vosk is a local and real-time speech recognition engine. It is used in this project to provide a faster and more accurate voice recognition experience without requiring a constant internet connection.

  ```bash
  pip install vosk
  ```

- **python-pptx**: This package is used for creating, manipulating, and modifying PowerPoint presentations. It is employed in Joseph Nicholls' project to dynamically generate slides, allowing automated PowerPoint presentation creation based on user input.

  ```bash
  pip install python-pptx
  ```

- **python-docx**: This package is used for creating and modifying Microsoft Word documents. It is used in the Juan Da Silva and Jesús Durán project to generate `.docx` documents based on user requests.

  ```bash
  pip install python-docx
  ```

- **playsound**: A simple package used for playing sound files. In this project, it is used to play the text-to-speech responses generated by the assistant, improving the user experience with audio interaction.

  ```bash
  pip install playsound
  ```

- **Gtts (Google Text-to-Speech)**: This package converts text into speech using Google's technology. It is used in this project to provide voice responses generated by the assistant, allowing the assistant to "speak" to the user.

  ```bash
  pip install gtts
  ```

- **y_dpl**: This package is used to interact with the YouTube API. In the Vincenzo Palladino and Augusto Anselmetti project, it is used to search for and download YouTube videos based on user input, automating the process of obtaining multimedia content.

  ```bash
  pip install y_dpl
  ```
